The raw file is very large, therefore cannot be uploaded in the repository. I have pasted the kaggle dataset link below
"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset"
You can directly download data from above.

I have used jupyter notebook and python for data cleaning and removing null values.
Did data manipulation and management of data.
Importing the final data into tableau for further analysis and making the dashboard.
Technologies Used:

●      Data Integration Tools: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools for collecting and processing data from diverse sources.

●      Data Visualization Libraries: Frameworks like Plotly, or Tableau for creating interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs.

●      Web Development Technologies: Front-end frameworks (e.g., Html, Css) and for building the dashboard interface and handling user interactions and netlify for creating a link of the code written.

Key Features:

Real-time Data Aggregation: The dashboard collects data from multiple sources, including kaggle, and industry reports, to provide up-to-date information on job trends.
Interactive Visualization: It utilizes interactive charts, graphs, and maps to present data in a user-friendly format, allowing users to explore trends based on various parameters such as industry, job title, location, and skill requirements.
Trend Analysis: The dashboard identifies emerging trends, skill demands, salary variations, and job growth/decline patterns across different sectors and regions.
Comparison Tools: Users can compare job trends over different time periods, benchmarking current data against historical trends to identify patterns and anticipate future changes.
Filtering and Customization: The dashboard offers filtering options to refine search results based on specific criteria such as experience level, education requirements, and job type (e.g., full-time, part-time, remote).
